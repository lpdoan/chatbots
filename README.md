# Creating Chatbots
Two chatbots that I made for the Computational Thinking course in my Masters' Data Science minor.
The project is written in Python 3.9
One bot is able to retrieve financial data with the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance package). 
The other bot is tasked with webscraping a sushi shop website and return a selection of sushi and their prices.
